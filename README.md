### You are here

So you are here either because you didn't get what Forever Game was (not your fault), or you want to learn more about it. You are in safe hands.

## What is it

Forever Game is played by watching a live game stream on twitch and cheering for your favourite team. Either privately or in the chat. Optionally, you can participate by betting made-up points on individual game outcomes. Points later allow you to influence what upgrades each team gets in the Forever Market. And, perhaps, something else as well? (Sly smile)

Each individual game is played between two teams of three bots. They compete to take control and hold capture points. When a team controls less capture points than their opponents, they will start losing "tickets". If the tickets run out or if you are behind in "tickets" when the timer ends - you lose and the other team wins. Bots can "shoot" each other and the damage dealt is determined by a rock-paper-scissors mechanic (you can see each bot's weapon at all times, which may switch when they respawn).

The game has various traits, stats, pickups to make the RNG nature of it surprising, but at least somewhat predictable.

## How long is it

Forever Game consists of championships. Each championship has a number of round robins (each team plays each other team once), forever markets and the finals. Finals are between the top two teams and the winners are champions. There is a little extra something at the end of each championship, then a little break and then onto the next championship.

## Why did I make it

Perhaps you can call it a personal art project. It comes from many different places: blaseball, Jelle's Marble Runs, fascination with creating fake sports logos and making up new rock-paper-scissors variants as a pre-schooler.

But most of all I wanted to explore how games obtain their meaning through the act of just observing them together with others. The strange moment of conciously watching a sports match for the frrst time in your life and slowly, but surely getting invested in something that has no real stakes and no real consequences. The joyous feeling of the magic circle getting formed by people invisibly joining their hands together.

My hope is that at least some viewers will get invested and will have their favourite bots and teams. But in any case, I made it because I couldn't not make it.
